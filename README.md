# PWB as used by [https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)

Great new for anyone interested in this project, a US appeals court has recently reaffirmed that web scraping is legal!!

https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/amp/

I am currently a bit busy with this project (which also also allows you to scrape real estate websites ;) [https://propertysquares.com/](https://propertysquares.com/) but will return to update it shortly.

Please get in touch if you are interested in helping me take this project forward.


## [Demo of PropertyWebScraper ](https://homestocompare.com/)

Previously there was a demo at [https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com](https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/)

I have had to take that down as heroku has cancelled thier free tier.  You can see it being used in production here though: [https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)

To use Property Web Scraper as a service you would make calls like:

[https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/retriever/as_json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightmove.co.uk%2Fproperty-for-sale%2Fproperty-68790657.html](https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/retriever/as_json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightmove.co.uk%2Fproperty-for-sale%2Fproperty-68790657.html)

## Support for importing properties from an MLS

PropertyWebScraper also supports connecting to different MLSs (Multiple Listing Services) in the US using RETS and Web Services.  This functionality is currently experimental and has only been implemented for 3 MLSs.  If there is a particular MLS for which you need support, open an issue with the details.

## Disclaimer

While scraping can sometimes be used as a legitimate way to access all kinds of data on the internet, itâ€™s also important to consider the legal implications. There are cases where scraping data may be considered illegal, or open you to the possibility of being sued. 

I created this tool in part as a learning exercise and am sharing it in case others find it useful. If you do decide to use this tool to scrape a website it is your responsibilty to ensure that what you are doing is legal.
