[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/RealEstateWebTools/property_web_scraper.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.org/RealEstateWebTools/property_web_scraper)

This project was created while I was working on another open source product called [PropertyWebBuilder](https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder) which allows real estate agents to create their own website with ease.  I wanted to provide a way to allow people to import their listings from other websites and found there was no easy way to do this.

The aim of PropertyWebScraper is to make it easy for anyone to import real estate data from any website.  Support for more and more websites will be added over time.

## Support for importing properties from an MLS

PropertyWebScraper also supports connecting to different MLSs (Multiple Listing Services) in the US using RETS and Web Services.  This functionality is currently experimental and has only been implemented for 3 MLSs.  If there is a particular MLS for which you need support, open an issue with the details.

## Disclaimer

While scraping can sometimes be used as a legitimate way to access all kinds of data on the internet, itâ€™s also important to consider the legal implications. There are cases where scraping data may be considered illegal, or open you to the possibility of being sued. 

I created this tool in part as a learning exercise and am sharing it in case others find it useful. If you do decide to use this tool to scrape a website it is your responsibilty to ensure that what you are doing is legal.
